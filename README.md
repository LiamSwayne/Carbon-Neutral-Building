# Carbon Neutral Building
A linear program that takes a set of parameters and calculates the cheapest combination of materials and carbon-offsets to build a carbon neutral building.

Exclusions:
- We are excluding the cost of site assessment. We assume that the land can be built on and a concrete foundation already exists, and that all floors are identical.
- We exclude the labor cost. The final estimate is the cost of materials only.

The test cases below are auto-generated by GitHub Actions every time a commit is made.
<!-- TEST CASE 1 -->
```python
Parameters given: 3 floor, 20 meter x length, 25 meter y length.

Cost of materials and offsets (measured in USD): $123304.87

Columns (measured in quantity):
Aluminum columns needed: [-0. -0. -0.]
Steel columns needed: [263. 175.  88.]

Carbon offsets (measured in acres):
Oak tree acres: 0.583294482610836
Slash pine acres: 1.1665889652216723
Eucalyptus tree acres: 1.166588965221672

Number of parking spaces needed: 166
